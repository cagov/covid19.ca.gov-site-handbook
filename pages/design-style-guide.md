The foundational layer of the design components are based on [Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com) as well as the latest version of the [CA state web template](https://beta.template.webstandards.ca.gov). Additionally several dynamic content components are built as portable [npm modules](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=cagov). 

## Typography
The main [COVID19](https://covid19.ca.gov) website uses Roboto and Montserrat typefaces. Mainly headings 1 through 4 are used throughout webpages. 

### Headings 
* **Heading 1:** Montserrat bold 700, font-size 2.3rem
* **Heading 2:** Montserrat bold 700, font-size 2rem
* **Heading 3:** Roboto bold 700, font-size 1.5rem
* **Heading 4:** Roboto bold 700, font-size 1.4rem

### Paragraph text 
* **paragraph:** Roboto regular 300, color #00000, font-size 1.2rem,  line height 1.5, paragraph spacing 1.2rem

## Colors
* **Primary color:** #1f2574
* **Secondary color:** #003d9d
* **Accent color:** #f2f5fc
* **Accent color:** #ff8000
* **Accent color:** #92C5DE

## Icons
The state web template includes an [icon font](https://beta.template.webstandards.ca.gov/sample/icon-fonts.html) and has several COVID related icons available. Additionally an open source [COVID icon font](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&q=covid-19&m=free) is also available and complements the state icon font. 

## Branding 
Branding elements are used lightly on the homepage. Homepage begins with a hero banner that has important information. Imagery in the hero banner is optional and should be blended with the primary color. 

* **Logos:** [California for all](https://gmmb.app.box.com/s/kv1pzeg52sznf4vyml6j31pd4o30tlfc)
* **Images:** [Hero banner/Backgrounds](https://govca.app.box.com/s/1vk3x2d20fjplsciqonrrohdrlr8vzs3)

## Page Layout
Different content regions should be inside full width sections with varying background shades of the color palette. Most important and relevant content should be positioned top to bottom.

## Social media shareability
All pages on every website should have a clear headline and thumbnail image that previews on social channels when shared as a link. Thumbnail images should not be cropped and the entire image should fit into the social preview thumbnail. 


## Web Toolkit
A toolkit website that contains communications materials as well as graphical banners and imagery is also available at [COVID19 Response Toolkit](https://toolkit.covid19.ca.gov/partners/).
